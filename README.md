# NLPkaggleDemo
Kaggle competition to predict if a disaster text is from emergency responders or not
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview

I've created code for BERT, roBERTa, and distilBERT

Scores for Kaggle competition:

BERT - .81765, Rank 291st out of 965

roBERTa - .80815

distilBERT - .77015

I had issues with the kaggle kernel around installing the transformers library.   I used colab and had to download CSV files from Kaggle, upload to colab, download submission file from colab and then submit file to kaggle competition.
